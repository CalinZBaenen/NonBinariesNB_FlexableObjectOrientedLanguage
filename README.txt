Hello,
thanks for downloading the FOOL programming language!
This project is open source (for now), so feel free to look at the code.
This requires:
Python 3.7.0
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you need help with how to code check 'FOOL Documentation.html', it will
have refrences and notes about it's updates, and the latest version.
If you have questions, suggestions, or bug reports, email me at:
